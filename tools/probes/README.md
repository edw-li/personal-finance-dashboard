# Browser probes and smoke drivers

Dev-box tools, never part of the app or the test suites. They drive a real headless browser
(Edge, `EDGE_PATH` overrides) so a chart is judged on real pixels — jsdom never draws, and the
2026-08-25 incident (a real category name collided with a sankey node and blanked a route) was
invisible to every unit test. Their output is an artifact: PNGs and `report.json` land in the
gitignored `scratchpad/`, never next to these tracked scripts.

| Tool | What it draws | Run |
|---|---|---|
| `charts-c4/`, `charts-c5/` | Static `probe.html` pages that feed the app's own `node_modules/echarts` the exact option shapes the builders emit (heat-treemap hierarchy, decals, `markArea`/`markPoint`, the piecewise price wash) | `node tools/probes/charts-c5/shoot.mjs` — no server needed |
| `charts-c7/smoke.mjs` | The whole app: every chart route in both themes at 1600×1000, plus tooltip (axis/item/sankey), the heatmap's three modes, the heat-treemap and the log-axis fan. Fails on any console error, any bare canvas outside a `.chart-card`, and any canvas that did not actually paint | needs the dev stack — see below |

## Running the C7 smoke against the dev servers (dev only)

Start the stack: backend `uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000` on `127.0.0.1:8000`, `npm run dev`
on `http://localhost:5173`. Then mint a token with the **dev seed credentials**
(`admin@example.com` / `changeme123` — dev database only, never a real one) and run the driver:

```bash
OUT=scratchpad/charts-smoke && mkdir -p "$OUT"
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"changeme123"}' \
  | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>process.stdout.write(JSON.parse(s).access_token))" > "$OUT/token.txt"
TOKEN_FILE=$OUT/token.txt SMOKE_OUT=$OUT node tools/probes/charts-c7/smoke.mjs
```

Prints `CHARTS SMOKE OK`, or exits 1 listing every problem. Env: `SMOKE_OUT`, `TOKEN_FILE`,
`APP_BASE`, `EDGE_PATH`, `PLAYWRIGHT_CORE`, `ONLY_THEME`, `ONLY_ROUTE`, `SKIP_WALK`,
`SKIP_DETAILS`. Known dev-data non-defects (a person with no paycheck profile 404ing,
`owner=joint` holding no positions) are recorded under `knownBenign` in `report.json` rather
than dropped, so a real regression hiding behind one stays visible.
